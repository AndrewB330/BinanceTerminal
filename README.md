# BinanceTerminal
Terminal for trading on [Binance.com](http://binance.com "Binance.com") exchange. Supports many kinds of custom orders.

## How does it work?
This is a python application that runs in the background on your server. There are two parts: server and terminal. Server is responsible for executing and maintaining orders, it uses MongoDB to save orders. Terminal is just a flask web-application that allows you to operate with your orders in a browser.
